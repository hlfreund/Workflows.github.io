Hello, and welcome to my page that is all about sequencing, bioinformatics, data science,and all things 'omics!


# My Background

My name is Hannah Freund, my pronouns are **they/them**, and I am a PhD Student at the University of California Riverside. I am in the [Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics PhD Program](https://ggb.ucr.edu/) and a member of Dr. Emma Aronson's lab.

I earned my Masters in Biology from California State University Long Beach in 2019. As a member of The Bioinformatics Lab led by Dr. Renaud Berlemont, I used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic tools to examine the gut microbial community from cartilaginous fishes. 

I am currently focusing on the characterization of aeolian (i.e. wind-driven) microbiomes as well as microbiome-microbiome interactions within the Salton Sea, CA.
