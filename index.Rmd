Hello, and welcome to my page that is all about sequencing, bioinformatics, data science,and all things 'omics!



# My Background

My name is Hannah Freund, my pronouns are they/them, and I am a PhD Student at the University of California Riverside. I am in the [Genetics, Genomics, and Bioinformatics PhD Program](https://ggb.ucr.edu/) and a member of Dr. Emma Aronson's lab.

I earned my Masters in Biology from California State University Long Beach in 2019. As a member of The Bioinformatics Lab led by Dr. Renaud Berlemont, I used shotgun metagenomic sequencing and bioinformatic tools to examine the gut microbial community from cartilaginous fishes. You can find my masters thesis [here](https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/insights-into-structure-function-gut-metagenome/docview/2294094842/se-2).

I am currently focusing on the characterization of aeolian (i.e. wind-driven) microbiomes as well as microbiome-microbiome interactions within the Salton Sea, CA.

A little more about me - I am a proud member of the queer, genderqueer community as an agender, bisexual scientist. For some more personal information about me, please feel free to see my profile on [500 Queer Scientists](https://500queerscientists.com/hannah-freund/).
